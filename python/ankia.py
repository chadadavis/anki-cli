# REPL options (interactive mode)
# # open the GUI for the current search query in browse mode (to edit/append cards)
# # https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect/blob/master/actions/graphical.md
#
# when checking for an existing word, print stats on age (use case: "why don't I remember this one? still new?")
# See cardInfo response fields: interval, due, reps, lapses, left, (ord? , type?)
# Lookup defs of fields, or just compare to what's displayed in card browser for an example card

# TODO make a CLI/REPL option to delete (or edit?) a card (by ID), for debugging
# That could just be part of the REPL after rendering a (set of?) card

# Have a REPL option to 'f'etch the card I'm viewing, if it exists locally, show them for comparison
# Have a REPL option to 'r'eplace the local card with the fetched.

# REPL: option to open [G]oogle if no results found in online dictionary
# And then open GUI dialog to add a new card?

# Don't search 'B'ack by default, but make it a REPL option.
# Search for 'W'ild by default if no exact match?
# For both: Pipe it into $PAGER by default

# Send to RTM as a fallback, when I need more research? (better as a separate thing, don't integrate it)
# Or just a simple queue in the CLI, that stays pending, keep printing it out
# ie just an option to defer adding a definition until later (in the run)
# That would be for when woorden.nl has no results, for example.


# Is this even worth it? What's the value?
# Cleanup (does this only apply to the ones that aren't already HTML?)

# Also note that some of these cleanups are only for display (rendering HTML)
# And others should be permanently saved (removing junk)

# Remove: 'Toon all vervoegingen'
# Remove: tweede betekenisomschrijving 
# If the back begins with the term, delete the term (multi-word)

# newline before these: '(?<=\s+)\S*(naamw|werkw|article|pronoun|...).*$'
# Lookup how to match to end of newline eg: '?m:(?<=\s+)\S*(naamw|werkw|article|pronoun|woord|...).*$'
# And also insert a newline before/after, to ease readability?

# Every occurrence of these words should be preceded by one/two newlines
# Use a negative look behind assertion? Or just cleanup 3+ newlines later
# (Could also put these bold/colored since they're headings, or maybe dim them since they're only structure not content)
# '(Uitspraak|Vervoegingen|Voorbeeld|Voorbeelden|Synoniem|Synoniemen|Antoniem|Antoniemen): '

# Wrap in [], the names of topical fields, when it's the last word on the line
# culinair medisch formeel informeel juridisch biologie kunst meteorologie landbouw

# Numbered section on its' own line? '?m:^([0-9]+)\)\s*'
# And all `text wrapped in backticks as quotes` should be on it's own line
# Also, remove/replace tab chars '	' (ever needed?)


# Bug: I cannot search for uitlaatgassen , since the card only contains: Verbuigingen: uitlaatgas|sen (split)
# Remove those too? But only when it's in 'Verbuigingen: ...' (check that it's on the same line)

# If I prompt with a diff, then I don't need to be so careful, just prompt to remove all of them, show diff

# Collapse multiple spaces (in between newlines)?
# Remove whitespace at the start of a line? Or keep the indentation? (sometimes helps)
# collapse 3+ newlines into 2 newlines everywhere

# Anki add: when populating readline with seen cards, the front field should be stripped of HTML, like the render function does already
# search for front:*style* to find cards w html on the front to clean (but then how to strip them ?)

# When cleaning, having a dry-mode to show what would change before saving
# Show a diff, so that I can see what chars changed where
# Warn before any mass changes to first do an export (via API?) See .config/backups/

# Anki Add, also parse out the spellcheck suggestions on the fetched page (test: hoiberg) and enable them to be fetched by eg assigning them numbers (single key press?)
